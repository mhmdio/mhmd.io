I'm Glad to pass this quick and easy CCP, this should be consider to get familiar with the exams, and if you are totally new to AWS, otherwise, you may take the CSA, or other higher certs.

## AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

Earners of this certification have a fundamental understanding of IT services and their uses in the AWS Cloud. They demonstrated cloud fluency and foundational AWS knowledge. Badge owners are able to identify essential AWS services necessary to set up AWS-focused projects.
