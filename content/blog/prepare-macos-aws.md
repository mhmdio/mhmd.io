Amazon EKS clusters require kubectl and kubelet binaries and the aws-iam-authenticator binary to allow IAM authentication for your Kubernetes cluster.

If you do not already have Homebrew installed on your Mac, install it with the following command.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## INSTALL KUBERNETES TOOLS

- kubectl

```bash
brew install kubectl
```

- aws-iam-authenticator

```bash
brew install aws-iam-authenticator
```

- jq

```bash
brew install jq
```

- envsubst

```bash
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext
```

## Verify

```bash
for command in kubectl aws-iam-authenticator jq envsubst
  do
    which $command &>/dev/null && echo "$command in path" || echo "$command NOT FOUND"
  done
```

## eksctl - a CLI for Amazon EKS

Instead of using AWS console to create EKS cluster, you can use a more simpler but powerfull tool.

eksctl is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS - Amazon’s new managed Kubernetes service for EC2. It is written in Go, and uses CloudFormation.

```bash
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl
```
