Salam, I got a chance to talk about Freelancing and finance issues, that faces freelancers from Palestine, how we can improve it, I talked on a radio show called "Chat Radio", and explain how we start freelancing work here in Gaza, and how we need new programs from Local Banks, to help you secure finance state.
