The long waited Terraform 0.12 is here !

Terraform 0.12 is a major update that includes dozens of improvements and features spanning the breadth and depth of Terraform functionality.

Some highlights of this release include:

- **First-class expression syntax**: express references and expressions directly rather than using string interpolation syntax.
- **Generalized type system**: use lists and maps more freely, and use resources as object values.
- **Iteration constructs**: transform and filter one collection into another collection, and generate nested configuration blocks from collections.
- **Structural rendering of plans**: plan output now looks more like configuration making it easier to understand.
- **Context-rich error messages**: error messages now include a highlighted snippet of configuration and often suggest exactly what needs to be changed to resolve them.
