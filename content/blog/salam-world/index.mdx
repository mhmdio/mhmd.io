Salam World, this is my first blog post, I'm testing the new blog ecosystem that is based on static file serving, I will stick with this theme for a while, may be for this year at least. I will add new plugins and customize this website to suites my need.

> I will create a webpage that describe the technology stack used to build this website, so any one can follow these steps to create a nice blog with minimal but excellent technologies and mostly free , that allow you on writing with hacking in mind.

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Salam World!")
}
```
