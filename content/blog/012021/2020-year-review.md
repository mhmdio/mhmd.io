## 2020, what a year

- 1 Workshop
- 1 Podcast
- 1 YouTube video
- 2 certificates
- 2 courses
- 5 OpenSource contributions
- 7 clients
- 7 AWS DevOps projects (which take most time!)
- 11 blog post

These numbers looks small, but at least I tried.

This year I will focus more on adding new useful content in both languages Arabic and English.

Also I will focus on learning more AWS, DevOps.
