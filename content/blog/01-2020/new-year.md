description: A new year and a new decade
---

what a decade, from 2010 to 2020 a lot of things happened, lot of life lessons, this is what occurred in the first week of the decade:

- Pass 4000 hours on UpWork as a Cloud Engineer. I'm very Proud.
- Update my personal website, now built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify
- New Hashicorp certificates on the way, for Terraform and Vault, looks promising.
- Pulumi jobs start appearing on UpWork, as expected, it will affect Terraform.
