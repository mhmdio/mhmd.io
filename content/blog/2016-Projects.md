This will be the new blog post to open every new year, which describe current year goals, and how the year before goals went, since there is no last year goals, I will stick with listing current year goals.

### My 2016 Projects:

1. Linux+
2. AWS CSA
3. Implement Openstack
4. learn python
5. Read 6 IT Books
6. Contribute to opensource projects
7. create a website - **DONE**

This year I will focus on improving my skills as cloud engineer, and since most of the big cloud services are based on linux, I need to start with Linux, I hope I can take the certifications.
